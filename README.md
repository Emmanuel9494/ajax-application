Dynamic Hotspots: Interactive hotspots on the 3D model that display additional information when hovered or clicked.
Material List: Fetch and display a list of materials dynamically from an API.
Error Handling: Displays fallback error messages and loaders when data fails to load.
Smooth Animations: Uses GSAP for animating hotspot interactions and transitions.
Responsive Design: Fully responsive, ensuring usability across devices.
